### Reminiscence of a young soul

This was the time where i remember my playing hours would come to an end, where i will have to return home & sit to study, where all of us sort of become upset to wind up the game & say goodbye .The time where the mohalla ka aunties(mostly house wives)also break away from their regular gossips & would go back to their respective houses. The time where all the uncles & few aunties would be returning home from work, the time where Amma would make the best adrak ki chai along with some mouth- watering pakodas that you can't resist from eating, where i have not yet learned how to pray namaz & that's why would rather recite suras instead, the time where bhajans in nearby mandirs would start to play & i had no clue what the words were but always found them soothing & peaceful. The time where the sound of shankhas could be heard as if calling everyone to return home; that the day is over. This was the time of Maghrib, the time where be it maghrib ki adhan or church bell or playing of bhajans..... every calling meant only one thing to me; the end of the day, which was celebrated by different people in different ways but in the end seeking the same truth. This was my childhood, happy, blessed & beautiful‚ù§

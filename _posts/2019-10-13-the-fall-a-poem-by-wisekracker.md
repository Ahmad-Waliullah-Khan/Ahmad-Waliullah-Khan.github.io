### The Fall

---

> Run, fall, dust yourself off,
> 
>
> and then run some more,
> 
> 
> At first,
> 
> 
> you'll stumble, fumble and mumble.
> 
> 
> After some time,
> 
> 
> you'll get frustrated,
> 
> 
> with the constant stumbling and falling.
> 
> 
> And that's ok.
> 
> 
> It's not about not falling.
>
> 
> The whole thing is an endless fall.
> 
> 
> The trick is to keep stumbling and falling,
> 
> 
> in the right direction.
> 
> 
> And who knows, 
> 
> 
> maybe you'll start enjoying this free-fall.
